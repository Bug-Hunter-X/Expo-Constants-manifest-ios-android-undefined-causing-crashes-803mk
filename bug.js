This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.manifest` property to access app information, specifically the `ios` or `android` keys.  If these keys are missing (perhaps due to a misconfiguration or incomplete build process), attempting to access them will cause the app to crash with a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ios')` or a similar error. This is particularly problematic because the error isn't always easy to debug, especially in complex applications where the access happens deep within the codebase.
